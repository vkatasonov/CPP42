# Piscine CPP 42

This repository contains solutions to projects of 42 school CPP Piscine. 
The Piscine CPP is an intensive C++ learning program focused on developing skills in object-oriented programming and advanced C++ concepts.

## What is all about
The exercises cover everything from building and managing classes, diving into object-oriented programming, and working with STL containers like vectors and maps. Memory management, including pointers and smart pointers, is also explored, along with writing flexible code using templates and operator overloading. There’s a strong emphasis on exception handling to ensure robust error management.
Take a look if you’re curious about how these challenges help build a solid foundation in C++!

## Usage

Each folder corresponds to a project from the Piscine CPP and contains the source code and corresponding tests. 
To compile and run `make` in each folder or compile each project manually using clang++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98 including necessary dependencies and headers.
